                <note>The 1905 Greening <q>Second Impression</q> appears to be a facsimilie of the 1902
                  edition, with a different advertisement on the verso of the half-title, a revised title
                  page, a revised List of Illustrations (letter facsimiles omitted), and an addition to the
                  Prefatory Note. The facsimiles of letters on pp.83-6 and pp.148-51 of the 1902 edition are
                  omitted, which results in differences in pagination: starting on p.83, there is a p.#+4
                  difference between the 1905 and 1902 editions (i.e., 1905 p.83 = 1902 p.87 [83+4]); starting
                  on p.144, there is a p.#+8 difference from the 1902 edition (ie, 1905 p.144 = 1902 p.152
                  [144+8]). The 1905 Appendix is an English translation of the <title>Gaulois</title> article that appears in
                  the original French in the 1902 Appendix. There is a leaf of Greening advertisements following the
                  Appendix.</note>

      <change> ch11_p008 and p009: Created "UID049" in order to mark up said tags. ch11_p017: <!--Is Varsity an organization? JD-->
        <!--No, S is speaking generally of public school and university morality JB--> ch11_p018: <!--Does "English colony" stand for Paris or for a particular English colony? JD-->
        <!--it refers to the resident English community in Paris JB--> ch12_p018: <!--Jason, could you confirm the markup for the "Vernissage" - it is a proper title in one sense but at the same time the exhibition is not explictly named. JD-->
        <!--Both the Salon and it Vernissage are references to events. The Vernissage is datable, but I would mark up the Salon as a place JB-->
        ch12_p024: <!--Jason, the last RA marked up the person at the door as UID026, however it is not clear if this is UID026. JD-->
        <!--ID issues will be dealt with later JB--> ch12_p003: <!--noticed that <said> tags cannot go inside <date> tags.-->
        <!--I revised the markup so this was no longer a problem--> ch12_p020: <!--Jason, will we markup numbers that appear as footers?-->
        <!--No, comment them out JB--> ch13_p004: <!-- should the “verdict” be marked up as a source text?-->
        <!--No JB--> ch13_p005: <!-- should the “jury had disagreed” be marked up as quote paraphrased?-->
        <!--No JB--> ch13_p007: <!-- Jason, Sherard paraphrases from a “rumour,” so I marked up with a said tag and # for the who key.-->
        <!--I wouldn't use <said> in this instance JB--> ch13_p015: <!-- Jason could you confirm markup for “mother’s house on Oakley Street,” i.e. placement of rs tags – 
          then I will make the appropriate note for the final edit – also note RA question ch15_p008-->
        <!--Markup is correct JB--> ch13_p018 and p019: <!--Jason, I have joined these two as a conversation, though OSW does not say anything in the first part –okay?-->
        <!--Yes, this makes sense-->
        <!-- can a gesture, sigh, or laugh represent speech? See also ch14_p012 note previous RA marked up the absence of speech as part of a conversation see ch16_p018, and laugh ch18_p006-->
        ch13_p021: <!-- Jason, there are variations of the Montaigne quotation, should I mark up the quote as a paraphrase?-->
        <!--No leave as is JB--> ch14_p004: <!-- this paragraph introduces the conversation to follow – confirm mark up as conversation i.e. direct=false, and confirm inclusion in join tag i.e. p004-p009 -->
        <!--the coaching tour offer should not be marked up with <said> and is not a part of the conversation--> ch14_p012:<!-- should the letter also be marked as a source text and again does the gesture function as speech within the larger implied conversations – markup as conversation? -->
        <!--No, it's not a conversation. The letter is a source text a portion of the content of which Sherard is summarizing JB-->
        ch14_p013 and p014: <!--  again, does “sigh” represent speech independent of conversation?-->
        <!--In both cases the sigh is not a response to something Sherard said to Wilde JB--> ch15_p003: <!-- not sure if the second rs person is Wilde or Daudet-->
        <!--The reference to 'my friend' is to Daudet--> ch15_p004: <!-- marked up “handsome sons” with double rs person tag – okay?-->
        <!--Yes JB--> ch15_p008: <!-- see previous RA question about house in Oakley Street -->
        <!--Not an issue; street is only being referred to as a means of identifying Wilde JB--> ch16_p007: <!--  the “shout” I have marked up as a singular act of speech okay?-->
        <!--Yes, okay for now JB--> ch16_p013: <!--  Jason, there is an implied conversation between the judge and the foreman – markup as conversation?-->
        <!--Yes JB--> ch16_p005: <!-- note previous RA question re: “The Evidence” see also p009 and p016 -->
        <!--Mark up with <rs type="person"> JB-->" ch17_p002: <!--  Sherard is referring to himself being quoted in a newspaper – confirm use of said tag within the quotation (near end of paragraph) -->
        <!--looks good. I added some additional said tags in the quotation since Sherard is being paraphrased/summarized JB-->
        ch17_p005: <!-- “HOME OFFICE” is orgName so “Home Secretary” persName – correct?-->
        <!-- No, roleName JB--> ch17_p006a: <!--  same for “Governor” see also ch19_p006-->
        <!--roleName JB--> ch17_p006 and p008: <!--  do we need to mark up Sherard’s inconsistent singular use of dq? -->
        <!--Yes JB--> ch17_p004: <!--note re dq (letter)– I could not put single dq outside orgName tag but could put sq outside salute tag-->
        <!--fixed JB--> ch17_p010: <!--Sherard is recording what the “warders” said – how to mark up said tag-->
        <!--mark up correct--> ch17_p012: <!--Is “The Greek movement” a title? -->
        <!--No JB--> ch18_p003: <!--markup used for house on Oakley Street  used for another example of a place – change if necessary see question ch13_p015-->
        <!--Markup is correct JB--> ch19_p006: <!--please confirm markup for “two American journalists” – also noticed the previous RA had omitted the who in the said tag –correct? See ch17_p010 the “warders” speech-->
        <!--I think this is fine at present JB--> ch19_p007: <!--Jason there appears to be an instance of said direct false followed by a said direct true – should I bracket this within a seg type=said tag?-->
        <!--Yes JB--> ch19_p010: <!--Sherard quoting  newspaper account- confirm markup for interruption of quote-->
        <!--This is just a mention of the topic of the newspaper letter, so took out all quote tags JB-->
        Ch19_p012: <!--confirm said tag inside a said tag -->
        <!--Correct. Might have to create a type for direct quotations within indirect ones JB--> Ch19_p013 <!--conversation begins before the said direct=true tags – confirm markup-->
        <!--Correct. JB--> Ch20_p003: <!--"Sub_prefect" persName like "Home Secretary"– correct?-->
        <!--Yes. JB--> Ch20_p006:
        <!--confirm markup of double said tags for implied indirect discussion that appears between explicit true speech – 
          note for last speech dq appear only at the end of the paragraph – (the implied indirect discussion is referenced in the last speech)-->
        Ch20_p007: <!--confirm markup of indirect speech noting direct speech within; and confirm markup of the “Ibsens” i.e. double persName tag-->
        <!--Correct. JB--> Ch20_p009:
        <!--confirm “these letters, these telegrams” as collective source_text--> Ch20_p009:
        <!-- need for collective “who” for “they” said speech – see end of paragraph--> Ch20_p009:
        <!--should there be an indirect said for the “probation period” i.e it is reported speech – see beginning of paragraph?-->
        Ch20_p009: <!--how to mark up wife’s family i.e. not two people but a collective who -->
        <!--Current markup in this paragraph is sufficient JB--> Ch20_p015: <!--confirm rs tags for “father” of the “friend”-->
        <!--Correct JB--> Ch20_p016:
        <!--confirm markup of “long discussion on literature” and “game” i.e. it is the reported discussion and game of three persons-->
        Ch20_p016: <!--p017, p018: note explicit use of indent convention (new paragraph) for speech is inconsistently applied (see first shift after
          “dressing-gown”) but marked up accordingly; solves the problem of joining p016 with the group-->
        <!--Markup corrected JB--> Ch20_p021: <!--the landlord is in conversation with Sherard reporting what Wilde said– confirm markup of said tags – 
           confusion with “He said” refers to what Wilde reportedly said but it is also the beginning of what the landlord’s speech  
           i.e it is followed by Sherard saying “I said” directed to the landlord-->
        <!--Markup corrected JB--> Ch21_p001: <!--“a refusal, slightingly worded” functions as both source text and quote of source text- note oXygen allows <quote> as outer bracket
          but not the other way around; also how to mark up “an offer of £3 a week was made to him by these people” 
          i.e. is the "offer" part of the earlier “refusal”? -->
        <!--Markup corrected JB--> Ch21_p002: <!--need plural for source text? Or plural for i.e. “advisors” see ch021_p001-->
        <!--No, letters in the abstract. Corrected markup JB --> Ch21_p005: <!--confirm mark up of double said tag for the two men who convey the news to Sherard-->
        <!--Correct JB--> Ch21_p008: <!-- conirm markup of “Club” (i.e. when part of proper name omitted) with  placeName, same for “Villa G” in p005, p009, and p010-->
        <!--Correct. JB--> Ch21_p016:<!-- confirm double rs tag markup for two plays -->
        <!--Correct. JB--> Ch21- end:<!-- I added div tags until error mark went away-->

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_preface_p001" rend="italic">The discreet method of publication which has
          been adopted for this book will, it is hoped, be accepted as deference to its opinion by that
          section of the public who, because in <rs type="person" key="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001">a man of
            genius</rs> the allied madness once got the upper hand, would consign him and the works which that
          genius created to the eternal night of eternal oblivion. A more weighty con- sideration still, which
          dictated this course, was to afford no opportunity, by causing a public revival of attention to his
          name, for those unjust reprisals upon his kinsfolk to which humanity, in this, as in every similar
          case, needs but the pretext of an incitement. My first chapter explains why the book was written. In
          this note <rs type="person" key="TWP_Personography.xml#SHR001">I</rs> wish to point out that my plea
          for the fairer consideration of my friend — one of the brightest geniuses of the last century — is
          delivered <hi rend="roman">a huis-clos</hi>, so that none but those invited need listen to it. If
          any eavesdropper cry <hi rend="italic">Scandal</hi>, he himself will be the cause of it.</p>

          enmity; and when catastrophe came upon him, what most of all astounded me was the volume of the base
          rancour that in so many breasts, lying upgathered, then burst forth upon him. For I cannot conceive
          that he excited jealousy. His superiority was so evident that rivalry could not surely raise its
          head on his path; and the success he won, as contrasted with what, by his parts, he might have
          achieved, was such as to inspire condolence rather than envy. Yet, jealousy of the most mean and
          petty order can alone have prompted the bitter hate that when the statue fell blazed up from beneath
          its feet. I am speaking, of course, of those who had known him, who had pretended friendship for
          him, and to whom his aberration had been no secret. </p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch05_p001">There was no selfishness in this assumed indifference.
            <persName key="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName>was at once a supreme egotist
          and the least selfish of men, — that is to say, that he combined complete individualism with a large
          and generous altruism. He had not the masked selfishness of self-sacrifice where his strong nature
          rebelled against the victimization of himself. </p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch05_p002" ana="#FH">He could not go against his nature to oblige
          another. He would not have divided his last shilling with a friend, but, what is infinitely more
          rare, he was always ready to give away his superfluity. This requires a higher generosity. The
          benefactor of the popular image, after all, <!--51-->
          <pb n="52"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> sacrifices a sixpence only. Now, <rs type="person"
            key="TWP_Personography.xml#SHR001">I</rs> have known <persName key="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001"
            >Oscar Wilde</persName>, who never invested a penny, give away hundreds of pounds. His comfort had
          to be assured; and he made no pretence, as some do, of philanthropy which imposed privation on
          himself. And no one who knew him, who had watched his physical life, could expect it of him, or
          blame as selfishness what was only egotism. In his intense joy of life, asceticism was impossible to
          his nature. It was a pleasure to watch his enjoyment at table, his delight in comfortable clothes,
          the bounding gratitude of all his being for all the good things of existence. <rs type="event"
            key="TWP_Chronology.xml#eu0005">I remember the childlike glee with which he once put on a new
            overcoat. He hugged himself for pleasure in its comfortable folds and said, <said direct="true"
              who="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001">So nice and warm.</said>
          </rs> It seemed absolutely the right of this nature to have all it wanted, and it was a real
          satisfaction to see its enjoyment of the sensualities of <!--52-->
          <pb n="53"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> life, — a spectacle which was a most refreshing relief in these days of sham
          Puritans and the bogus self-denials of the sorriest Tartuffes. His faults of sensuality, if they may
          so be styled, were open and undisguised. You might watch them as you might have watched a King of
          France at Versailles, for he feasted in public. </p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch05_p003" ana="#FH">But there was nothing coarse or gross in his
          sensualism. He was a man of too much refinement to overstep the line. <rs type="person"
            key="TWP_Personography.xml#SHR001">I</rs> never once saw him drink to excess; and that he always
          held a whiphand over his habits was shown to me by the ease with which he adapted himself to the
          prison regulations. On hearing of <event>his arrest</event>, I had fancied that the privation of
          tobacco would be torture to him, for he was an incessant smoker of cigarettes. He used to order
          these by the thousand, and I have seen him in <placeName key="TIS001">Tite Street</placeName>
          carrying with him, as he moved from one room to <!--53-->
          <pb n="54"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> another, a box of cigarettes of the size of a large biscuit-tin. <rs type="event"
            key="TWP_Chronology.xml#e1883_1889_001">I remembered that once in <placeName key="CHS001">Charles
              Street</placeName>, where I was living in the same house as he, my cigarettes having given out
            in the night, I was driven to get up and go to the sitting-room where we had spent the evening, to
            grope in the fender and fireplace for any cigarette ends which we had thrown away. Whilst I was so
            engaged, the door opened stealthily, and <persName key="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001">Oscar
              Wilde</persName> came in, with a look of much concern on his face. He had, he confessed, come on
            the same errand as myself. </rs>
        </p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch05_p004" ana="#FH">Accordingly, I imagined he must be suffering badly
          in <placeName key="HOG001">Holloway Gaol</placeName>, and out of sympathy, laid the penance of
          abstinence from tobacco for as long on myself also. <rs type="event"

          <rs type="person" key="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001">He</rs> had the sheer horror of physical
          ugliness, and avoided the society of those who appeared to him ill-favoured. This explains <rs

          artistic temperament. It has been observed, without arousing comment, in other prominent men.</p>

              <persName key="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName>, was such that he could not

              <persName key="TWP_Personography.xml#PAV001">Lelian</persName>, by the way, carried off from
            this interview no other impression than that the English poet had an abundant stock of superior
            cigarettes, whilst he had to content himself with a penny screw of inferior tobacco. I suppose
            that all the brilliant things that <persName key="TWP_Personography.xml#WIO001">Wilde</persName>
            said were lost upon the simple <persName key="TWP_Personography.xml#PAV001">Verlaine</persName>,

          bitter word for the many friends who betrayed him. This admirable quality reached to heroism in his

          horror of his fate, he essayed in nowise to lessen the crushing fardel of his infamy, by shifting on
          to other shoulders any portion of its burden. </p>

          we were talking together after lunch her answer came. It was unfavourable; yet, though he had
          founded great hopes on the production of this play, he gave no sign of his disappointment. I can
          remember his tearing a little piece off the blue telegraph-form and rolling it up into a pellet and
          putting it into his mouth, as, by a curious habit, he did with every paper or book that came into

          </said>, where he was living in rooms. The street has since been transformed, and now goes by the

          the <placeName key="COH001">Coburg Hotel</placeName>, has been pulled down. It was an old house, and
          the rooms on the third floor which <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName> occupied were
          panelled in oak, and there were old engravings in heavy black frames on the wall. </p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch07_p010"> The house was kept by a <rs type="person" key="">retired

          We often invited guests to this first meal, and over Parascho cigarettes and fine liqueurs

          <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName> took me to a reception at his <rs type="person"

            >Grosvenor Square</placeName>, in a charming little house which belonged to <persName key="WIW001"
            >Willy Wilde</persName>. I was presented as having a <rs type="title" key="">volume of poems</rs>
          in the press, and was graciously received. Later on, as I was standing talking to <persName
            key="ANK001">Anne Kingsford</persName>, <persName key="JFW001">Lady Wilde</persName>, holding some
          prim- roses in her hand, crossed the drawing-room, repeating, <said direct="true" who="JFW001"
            >Flowers for the <rs type="person" key="SHR001">poet</rs>! Flowers for the poet!</said> It was for

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch07_p011"> It was a curious existence, this life in <placeName
            key="CHS001">Charles Street</placeName>, <placeName key="GRS001">Grosvenor Square</placeName>, not
          without humour. The fact was that, in despite of an address which implied opulence, we were both
          very poor. <persName key="WIO001">Oscar</persName>’s <placeName key="">American</placeName>lectures
          had not been productive, and the <title key="DOP001" rend="italic">Duchess of Padua</title> had
          realised nothing. <rs type="person" key="SHR001">My</rs> friend accordingly was obliged, much

          lecture in the <rs type="place" key="">provinces</rs>. It was a real penance to him, and I could
          understand this after I had seen how <rs type="source_text">his lectures were advertised in the

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch07_p014"> On these <date>occasions of his return to town</date> we

            <persName key="JAW001">Whistler</persName> was very marked. He seemed to take pleasure in paying

          <pb n="94"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> sayings seemed to delight my friend. I was with him, by the way, also, when the

            <date>then</date> or <date>later</date>, in resentment.</p>


        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch07_p015"> During <rs type="person" key="SHR001">my</rs> hungry

          <rs type="person" key="WIO001">my friend</rs> was away, I often used to look out of the third-floor
          window to watch the carriages of the opulent householders of <placeName key="">Mayfair</placeName>
          returning from <placeName key="OXS001">Oxford Street</placeName>. There was usually a pile of

          come into the room we did not know whether he was coming. The <rs type="source_text" key=""
            >telegram</rs> which he had sent me in answer to my invitation, like every piece of prose he
          wrote, was worded in so intricate and obscure a manner that neither <persName key="WIO001"
            >Wilde</persName> nor myself had been able to get at its meaning, though we had spent the whole
          period of the <foreign>apéritif</foreign> puzzling over it. </p>

          the event of my mischance. The good fellow, in true friendship to me, was greatly alarmed, and was
          for informing the police, <!--115-->
          <pb n="116"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> so that the duel, with what he deemed <said direct="true" who="UID019">its
            suicidal conditions</said>, should be stopped. However, before doing so, <date>he went to
              <placeName key="TIS001">Tite Street</placeName> to consult <persName key="WIO001">Oscar
              Wilde</persName>
          </date>, who, I am glad to say, was able to dissuade him from an act which would have put me under
          taboo in <placeName key="PAR001">Paris</placeName> for the rest of my days. And after the business
          was over, I received a <rs type="source_text" key="">letter</rs> from <persName key="WIO001"
            >Wilde</persName>, which was a great comfort to me in a moment of very sore distress. He knew the

            <date>Renunciations of him by mutual friends began to occur</date>, distressing me greatly, for I
          refused, on the strength of my long knowledge of him, to believe the evil rumours which prompted

          expressed the most violent anger, in my presence and that of another man, at a letter breaking off
          acquaintance, which a <rs type="person" key="UID020">young French poet</rs> had written him. This
          young man, who since has stepped into the very first rank of French authors, was an intimate friend
          of mine, and he told me that though he had never seen in <persName key="WIO001">Wilde</persName>'s

          this rumour was getting such a hold on society in <placeName key="PAR001">Paris</placeName> that,
          for his own dignity, he was obliged to cease a friendship which he should always regret. I remember
            <persName key="WIO001">Wilde</persName>'s saying, <said direct="true" who="WIO001">How I wish that
            I knew the use of arms, so that I could punish these fellows as they deserve.</said> And I believe
          to <date>this day</date> that his anger was sincere, not feigned for the circumstance. I felt this

          <pb n="119"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> his disregard of French taste in this matter. For instance, he was fond of
          wearing gorgeous fur coats. Now, in <placeName key="PAR001">Paris</placeName>, gentlemen never wear
          fur coats; they are the distinctive garb of dentists and opera-singers, people with whom men of the
          world in <placeName key="FRA001">France</placeName> do not care to associate. He cultivated, to his

          occasion. He looked bloated. His face seemed to have lost its spiritual beauty, and was oozing with
          material prosperity. And his conversation also was not agreeable. I concluded that too much good
          living and too great success had momentarily affected him both morally and physically. There is an
          American slang-phrase which exactly describes the impression which he produced upon me. He seemed to
          be suffering from a swollen head! That I could understand. After the stress of years and a long
          period of heart-gnawing insecurity of position, he had caught the tide of unbounded prosperity. His

          aggressiveness in his tone, and in one remark he actually wounded me. He had been telling me in

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch13_p003">There are times, when one takes a perverse delight in going
          to meet distress of mind, possibly because one flatters oneself that he has abundant resources of
          courage and resistance with which to face it. <rs type="person" key="SHR001">I</rs> went
          accordingly, and, amidst pothouse surround- ings, waited with the anxiety of one, the life of whose
            <rs type="person" key="WIO001">dearest friend</rs> is at stake.</p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch13_p004">A coarse crowd of Englishmen, journalists, bookmakers and
          racing-touts surrounded the <rs type="place" key="">bar</rs>, which, in the exhilaration and
          excitement of the hour, did excellent trade. Bets as to the verdict were freely made, though, from
          the odds offered, there seemed to be but little doubt of a conviction. An incomprehensible hostility
          animated the conversation against the prisoner, yet almost without exception those who so discoursed
          were past-masters in every form of vice. The lewd faces, flushed with alcohol, mouthing imprecations
          against the <rs type="person" key="WIO001">unhappy man</rs>, at that moment in such dire straits, <!--156-->

          of a dream of the corridors of Hell. Filthy jests were bandied over the clinking tumblers. There was
          more deliberate vice engendered in that hour than many an unconscious madman crowds into his whole,
          irresponsible career.</p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch13_p005">At last the <rs type="thing" key="BLE001">blue envelope</rs>
          was handed over the bar-counter — the eagerly expected <rs type="source_text" key="">telegram</rs>
          from the <orgName key="">Old Bailey</orgName>. It was torn open, perused with gloating eyes, and
          flung down with an oath of bitter disappointment. The trial was over, the jury had disagreed, and
          the presumption was that a soul had been snatched from perdition. In the odious clamour of baulked
          cruelty that arose, hope within me began to lift its head, and <rs type="person" key="SHR001">I</rs>
          hastened off to communicate with <rs type="person" key="WIO001">my friend</rs>, leaving the rest to

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch13_p007">Yet, in consolation, there was the rumour that the prison
          gates would soon be opened, and that, though substantial bail would be exacted, so that appearances

          was treated, was the reparation officially exacted from him for an attitude which was a credit to
          himself and an honour to his friends.</p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch13_p008">As <date>soon</date> as it was known in <rs type="place"

          we read, a poignant feeling grew upon <rs type="person" key="SHR001">me</rs> that his dubious

          under tragic conditions in <date>1900</date>, in a poor cottage to which I had brought him, ragged,
          starving, and abandoned. He spent an hour or two at Oakley Street, and managed to comfort our friend
          by his mere presence. Dowson was a scholar and a master of English prose, and, as such, was greatly

          indifferent to all things. I remember an incident which occurred on <date>the night which preceded
            the first day of his trial</date>. Had I been in his position it would have gladdened me. We were

          <!--Oscar Wilde--> the <rs type="place" key="">house in <placeName key="">Oakley

          went out to answer it, and having opened the door, saw the tall figure of <rs type="person"

          He said nothing, but laid the guerdon aside, with a gesture of complete indifference. Nor was he in

          for more than an hour without speaking. Now and then the oppression on his breast would re- lieve
          itself in a sigh. I could imagine the workings of that fine brain and the horrors that his fancy
          evoked. Hope conflicting with doubt, the awful prospect before him, the wild regret of his folly,
          were like so many demons that unceasingly harried him. He suffered all the tortures of brain-fever
          without its merciful coma. For the rest, he was in high fever <date>all the time</date>, as was
          shown by his devouring thirst. He consumed gallons of liquid daily, and I was running out time and
          time again to fetch lemonade and soda-water and claret from the <rs type="place" key="">grocery at

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch14_p014">When we did speak, it was, as usual, on matters of
          literature, but with what deep distress I observed that he spoke as a man to whom all these things,
          in which he had once rejoiced, were dead. I thought of a passage in <persName key=""

          boyish way. But a few minutes later he relapsed into the awful silence that was so eloquent to me,
          the silence which now and again was broken by a heavy sigh.</p>

          the tragedy, long drawn out, of <date>those cruel days</date>. Not one word of recrimination ever
          passed his lips. He attached blame to no one. He sought to involve no one. He had no thought of
          vengeance, or even of resentment, against those who had encom- passed his so formidable ruin. He
          bent his broad shoulders, and essayed with his sole strength to bear the crushing burden of infamy
          and fate. He never showed himself to me more fine than in the days when the whole world was shouting
          out that he was of men the vilest.</p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch14_p016">He was prepared for his punishment, although hope lingered

          which one hopes not to recover. My mental and moral condition resembled those of the unhappy youth

          So, <date>after completing with <persName key="ALD001">Alphonse Daudet</persName> the outline of our

            <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName> was confined. And here, in a dazed condition, I

          became entitled to his first quarterly visit. The ticket which was sent me from the prison would

          </seg> It appears, then, that our conversation went at once to literature, the one subject of our
          common interest. We were <!--205-->
          <pb n="206"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> in a <rs type="place" key="">vaulted room</rs> which was like the prison of a
          transpontine melodrama, and we were separated by a double row of stout iron bars. In the passage
          between stood a warder, who kept his eyes fixed on a noisy clock which hurried the spare allowance
          of minutes along. We both clung to the iron bars, and both for support. I noticed that his hands
          were disfigured, and that his nails were broken and bleeding; also that his head and face were
          untidy with growth of hair. And that is all that I noticed, for I looked at his face all the time,
          and if he was in some hideous uniform I did not see it. He was greatly depressed, and at one time
          had tears in his eyes. I affected a cheerfulness which I was far from feeling, and I fancy that I
          managed to comfort him a little, for I remember that I won a laugh from him in the end. And just
          then the busy clock hiccoughed out my congé, and I had to stagger away. The visiting-room is so <!--206-->
          <pb n="207"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> badly constructed that many things said in it between prisoners and their friends
          remain inaudible. I could not help thinking of what must be the feelings of people who pay a
          farewell visit in that room to a man under sentence of death, and who afterwards recall the fact —
          that he said many things which they could not hear and may now never know.</p>

          sufferings never ceased to occupy my mind, was a happy, unshackled, and comfortable man, as compared

          <!--Oscar Wilde--> wire-grating was nailed, as though for the caging of an animal — noxious

            Gaol</placeName></rs>, melodramatic as they seemed, invested the interview with a sense of danger,

          asked was what was so entirely refused to <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName> after his
          release. In other countries, once a man has paid his debt to Society, as the formula is, he is held
          quits. Whoever in <placeName key="">France</placeName> brought up against <persName key="PAV001"
            >Paul Verlaine</persName> that he had suffered imprisonment in <placeName key=""
            >Belgium</placeName> for offences against the criminal law? — <persName key="PAV001">Paul
            Verlaine</persName>, who was publicly received and feted in <placeName key="ENG001"
            >England</placeName> by the very people who clamoured most loudly that <persName key="WIO001"
            >Oscar Wilde</persName> was dead to Society and to literature, and might never be resuscitated! In
            <placeName key="">England</placeName>, if a man fall, he falls never to rise again. There are in
          the British a certain bloodthirstiness and a certain instinctive cruelty, which not centuries of <!--226-->
          <pb n="227"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> Protestant practice have been able to moderate. These qualities of the nation
          account for the facts that not only is our penal legislation the severest in the world, but that a
          conviction entails immed- iate and irreparable social death on the offender.</p>

          <rs type="person" key="SHR001">My</rs> remarks to the <rs type="person" key="">Rescue officer</rs>
          meant, that having paid my debt to Society, I only required that Society should have sufficient
          charity to allow me to ply my trade, to earn my living, — in other words, without remembering
          against me that I had been in prison, that it should judge my writings on their merits and market
          value alone, without prejudice as without favour. <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde </persName> had
          all the more right to expect this of Society, that his past literary career, at least, was one of
          the purest of which English literature has record. I do not think that his bitterest enemies can
          find in any of his writings a single line which contains a <!--227-->
          <pb n="228"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> coarse suggestion. He was as moral in his writing as he was moral in his

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch19_p003">It would have been all gain to <placeName key=""
            >England</placeName>, and a great gain, if after his release he had found encouragement to write.
          He had been through the furnace, he had drunk of the waters of death, and a great spiritual mission
          might have been his. I know that he left prison with a lofty ideal before him and a firm purpose.
          There were discharged <date>on that morning</date> together with him a dozen other prisoners,
          labourers and artisans. For these Society found tools and employment On the man of genius, who could
          have added to her intellectual treasure-house incomparable wealth. Society turned her back.</p>

          <!--Oscar Wilde--> rage, and the knowledge that his great talents could never serve him again. The
          bricklayer who had come out of the prison with him would be making bricks on the morrow and earning
          a sufficient living, whilst he was condemned to inactivity, to a moral starvation, more cruel to a
          man of his temperament than the actual privation which his circumstances threatened.</p>


        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch19_p005">What an opportunity was lost here by some man of wealth, and

            >me</rs>, that much of the bitterness manifested against him in the press, was caused by his
          contemptuous and unfair remarks about the profession of journalism. These were all the less
          excusable on his part that he knew <placeName key="">Paris</placeName> well, and had a great
          admiration for French litterateurs, and knew that there is not, and has not been, a single French
          writer of any eminence who has not passed through journalism, and always to his great advantage. I
          was always sorry to hear his utterances on this subject, not indeed because the profession is one I
          have followed, and hold can so be exercised as to be one of the noblest in the world, but because it
          seemed to me unworthy of him to share a prejudice, essentially English and vulgar, which arises from
          the fact that most <!--231-->
          <pb n="232"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> journalists in <placeName key="">England</placeName>, ill-paid and anonymous, are
          in a humble position in life, with no footing in that sphere of Society which he, first of all,
          should have despised. A saying of his went the rounds of Paris <date>a year or two before his
            death</date>, in which he formulated his utter disdain for journalists. <rs type="person"
            key="UID041">An English newspaper-correspondent</rs> having for money acted in a public matter in

          <!--Oscar Wilde--> prison life seemed to have benefited him considerably. I was particularly struck
          with this <date>on the morning after my arrival at the villa at <placeName key="BER001"
              >Berneval</placeName></date>, when I accompanied him down to the beach where he was to take his
          morning swim. The fact that he took a swim in the sea every day was decidedly a cheerful one. For
          the purpose of undressing he had had a <rs type="place" key="">small cabin</rs> built for him on the
          beach, and <date>that morning</date> the door and the shutters had got stuck and refused to open. In
          the old days he would have said, <said direct="false" who="WIO001" rend="dq">This is very
            tedious</said>, and he would have sent for somebody to force the door. As it was, it was a
          pleasant and refreshing sight to see how <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName>, reputed an
          effete voluptuary, <soCalled rend="sq">went for</soCalled> that cabin — I can find no other word to
          describe his action — how brisk and vigorous he was with his hands, and with what promptitude his
          muscles mastered the opposiion. He showed me that, from a physical <!--241 16-->
          <pb n="242"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> point of view, his imprisonment had benefited him. It had made him physically
          more manly. As a matter of fact, he had all the makings of an athlete in him, and this never
          impressed itself more strongly upon me than <date>on the morning of which I am speaking</date>,
          whilst I was watching him breasting the waves, a strong and skilful swimmer. </p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p007">

              and says, <q rend="dq">Tak for Mand</q>,— <q rend="dq">Thanks for the Meal</q>.</said>
          </seg><persName key="WIO001">Wilde</persName> said nothing at the time, but later on in the evening,

              hands with her and to say that he had passed a pleasant evening.</said></seg> This was the first
          sign I had had that his humiliation and suffering had embittered him. It indicated what great moral
          and mental injury had been done him by the torture he had undergone.</p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p008">A delightful study, full of books, pictures, and flowers, had
          been prepared on the ground-floor of the <rs type="place" key="">villa</rs>, but it was never used

          to bend himself to such employment. <!--245-->
          <pb n="246"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> Like all artists, the money consideration was to him only secondary; the prime
          reward for labour that he looked for was the reputation, the increase of fame, that it could bring.
          In anonymous writing, to which thenceforward, as the British public would have it, he was
          constrained, all stimulus to endeavour, as far as he was concerned, was wanting. He simply could not
          produce under conditions to which excitement was lacking. For that his former triumphs had spoiled
          him, and <date>long past were the days</date> when he used at regular hours on regular days to plod
          up the <placeName key="STR001">Strand</placeName> to his <rs type="place" key="">city office</rs>. </p>


        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p009">
          <date>At the same time</date>, anxiety as to <rs type="person" key=" WIO001">his</rs> future was
          harassing him at every moment. Beyond the few hundreds which had come to him <date>after his

            key="COL001">wife</rs>'s family to alienate her from him had been so far successful, that a

          <!--Oscar Wilde-->
          <date>period of probation</date> had been imposed upon him. She would wait to see how he conducted
          himself before giving effect to <date>the reconciliation which had taken place across the double row
            of iron bars in <placeName key="WAG001">Wandsworth Gaol</placeName></date>. <date>At the same
            time</date>, he was being plied with letters and telegrams by the <rs type="person" key="">one of
            his former friends</rs> whom it was most fatal for him to remember. <rs type="source_text" key=""
            >These letters, these telegrams</rs>, <quote source="#" type="paraphrased">petulantly clamoured

          meeting all chance of a moral rehabilitation would be lost, his wife and children definitely
          divorced from him, and his traducers of the past justified almost in the eyes of his very friends.
          During <date><rs type="person" key="SHR001">my</rs> short stay at <placeName key="BER001"
              >Berneval</placeName></date> there came from <rs type="person" key="">this source</rs> several
          telegrams, which kept my poor host in a constant tremor of irritation and perplexity. He wished for
          a new life, and yet there seemed no other prospect open to him but to fall back into the old
          associations which <!--247-->
          <pb n="248"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> had ruined him. Society had closed every door upon him, wherever British
          influence extended. Thus it was not an infrequent occurrence that he was insulted in <placeName
            key="DIE001">Dieppe</placeName> by being refused admittance to houses of entertainment which were
          visited by English people, and at the request of these. <date>On one occasion</date> he was invited
          to dinner by <rs type="person" key="UID046">a well known artist</rs>. There were two other guests.
          The artist took his three friends to the <rs type="place" key="">best restaurant in <placeName
              key="DIE001">Dieppe</placeName></rs>. They sat down at a table and called for the waiter. The
            <rs type="person" key="UID047">proprietor of the establishment</rs> presented himself in his
          place. <seg type="said"><said direct="true" who="UID047">I much regret,</said> he said, <said

              but not for four.</said></seg> It appeared that certain English people residing in Dieppe had
          told the landlord that <said direct="false" who="#">if <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName>
            were ever served at his establishment they would withdraw their custom.</said> And this is only
          one instance of the cruel insult to which this <!--248-->
          <pb n="249"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> unhappy and forsaken man was exposed at the hands of his countrymen.</p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p010"> His money was fast running out. <date>At the time when <rs
              type="person" key="SHR001"/>I visited <placeName key="BER001">Berneval</placeName></date>, he
          had come almost to the end of the few hundreds. I know that he used <said direct="false"
            who="WIO001">to complain of the carriage he had to pay on the telegrams from <rs type="person"
              key="">his friend</rs></said>, for Berneval is a long way from <rs type="place" key="">a
            telegraph office</rs>, and on each of these idiotic and childish messages three or four shillings
          had to be paid. That <persName key="WIO001">Oscar Wilde</persName> should have made a remark on this
          expense proved to me that his anxiety as to his financial position, if concealed, was very keen.</p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p011">
          <rs type="person" key=" WIO001">His</rs> nature revolted against the work that offered itself for
          him to do. <said direct="true" who="WIO001">I would rather continue stitching sacks</said>, he said.
          For the rest, dizzy with his new-gained liberty, and striving to forget in pleasure and excitement
          and a temporary luxury the suffering and privations of the past, the <!--249-->
          <pb n="250"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> constant humiliations of the present, and the awful preoccupation of the future,
          he was in no state of mind for literary production. And it was to literary production alone that he
          could look for any income. </p>

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p012"> But for <rs type="person" key="WIO001">his</rs> natural
          dignity and a strange respect for Society, to which, although he had spent his life deriding it, he
          felt a deference and an obligation which his supreme delicacy could alone explain, he could have
          exploited to great material advantage the notoriety of his name, and the universal and considerable
          sympathy which in tolerant <placeName key="PAR001">Paris</placeName> the story of his terrible
          sufferings had won for him. In Paris he was looked upon as the victim of British hypocrisy.
          Culpability, even where it was admitted, was discussed with a smile, and the punishment inflicted
          seemed, accord- ing to French views, so enormous, that in the eyes of the Parisians a very halo of
          martyrdom surrounded his head. </p>

        <!--250-->

        <!--Oscar Wilde-->

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p013">Had <rs type="person" key=" WIO001">he</rs> cared to do so,
          he could have earned large sums of money by contributing, in his real name, to leading French
          newspapers and reviews. Thus, <date>during <rs type="person" key="SHR001">my</rs> stay at <placeName

        <p xml:id="Sherard1902Unhappy_ch20_p014">But no. On the one hand, <rs type="person" key=" WIO001"
            >he</rs> was too proud, his self-respect was too great, to exploit for his profit a notoriety
          which haunted his every waking moment with a burning shame; and on the other hand, he felt that he
          owed it to Society, to British Society, to do nothing to keep alive a scandal by which that virtuous
          and dignified section of humanity had suffered so much in its lofty pride and spotless reputation.
          He would raise out of the slough into which he had been cast no beckoning hand. He had wrapped
          himself in a shroud as in a cloak; and though tingling with life in every fibre, contented <!--251-->
          <pb n="252"/>
          <!--Oscar Wilde--> himself to play the dead. No individual ever manifested a higher, a more
          unselfish conception of his duty towards the collectivity. He had been branded a moral leper; and
          although none better than himself knew how cruelly unjust was this stigmatisation, he bowed to the
          verdict of his countrymen, and of his own free will withdrew to the lepers’ island — to the awful
          lazzaretto where all was silence and night. And what recognition has ever been granted to him for
          this astounding sacrifice of self to the reputation of <rs type="place" key="">a country</rs> of
          which neither by descent, nor temperament, nor character was he a citizen? None, Prison had failed
          to degrade this prisoner. He left <placeName key="REG001">Reading Gaol</placeName> improved, refined
