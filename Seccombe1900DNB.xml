            younger son of Sir William Robert Wills 
            Wilde [q. v.], who married, in 1851, Jane 
            Francisca Elgee (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1896), a granddaughter 
            of Archdeacon Elgee of Wexford [see under 
            WILDE, SIR W. R. W.] Oscar Wilde's elder 
            brother, William Charles Kingsbury Wilde 
            (1853-1899), a journalist, who wrote much 
            for the ‘World’ and the ‘Daily Telegraph,’ 
            died in London in March 1899. His mother, 
            who wrote under the signature ‘Speranza,’ 
            had a literary salon at Dublin, where much 
            clever talk was listened to by the children.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="Seccombe1900DNB_p002">
            After education at Portora royal school, 
            Enniskillen, Oscar Wilde studied during 
            1873-4 at Trinity College, Dublin, where he 
            won the Berkeley gold medal with an essay 
            on the Greek comic poets. He matriculated 
            from Magdalen College, Oxford, 17 Oct. 
            1874, holding a demyship at Magdalen from 
            1874 to 1879, and graduating B.A. in 1878. 
            In 1877, during a vacation ramble, he visited 
            Ravenna and Greece, in company with Professor Mahaffy, and in June 1878 he won the 
            Newdigate prize with a poem on ‘Ravenna.’ 
            He was greatly impressed by Florence and 
            by the lectures of Ruskin, spending several 
            whole days in breaking stones upon the road 
            which the professor projected near Oxford. 
            He had from his youth a strong antipathy 
            to games, though he was fond of riding. 
            His precocity, both physical and mental, 
            was exceptional, and while still at Magdalen 
            he excogitated his aesthetic philosophy of 
            ‘Art for Art's sake,’ of which he was recognised at once as the apostle, and
            enunciated the aspiration that he might be able 
            to live up to his blue china. His rooms, over-looking the Cherwell, were notorious for their 
            exotic splendour, and Wilde's bric-à-brac was 
            the object of several philistine outrages. 
            
            <!--VOL. III.&amp;x2014;SUP.--> 
            
        <cb n="2"/>
            
            The abuse of foes and the absurdities of 
            friends alike furnished material for persiflage. His wit was undoubted, and he 
            successfully cultivated the reputation (not 
            wholly deserved) of being a complete idler. 
            He had a natural aptitude for classical 
            studies, and he obtained with ease a 
            first-class both in classical moderations 
            (1876) and in <foreign>literæ humaniores</foreign> (1878). He 
            had already written poems, marked by 
            strange affectations, but with a classical 
            finish and an occasional felicity of detail. 
            These had appeared in the ‘Month,’ the 
            ‘Catholic Mirror,’ the ‘Irish Monthly,’ 
            ‘Kottabos,’ and in the first number of 
            Edmund Yates's periodical called ‘Time.’ 
            A selection of these juvenile pieces was 
            printed in 1881 as ‘Poems by Oscar Wilde’ 
            (reprinted in New York, 1882). On leaving 
            Oxford Wilde was already a well-known 
            figure and a favourite subject for caricature 
            (notably in ‘Punch,’ and later as Bunthorne 
            in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera, 
            ‘Patience’). He was recognised as the 
            founder of the aesthetic cult, the symbols of 
            which were peacocks' feathers, sunflowers, 
            dados, and blue china, long hair, and velveteen breeches. His sayings were passed from 
            mouth to mouth as those of one of the professed wits of the age. His fame crossed 
            the Atlantic, and in 1882 he made a tour 
            through the United States, lecturing two 
            hundred times in such cities as New York, 
            Boston, and Chicago, upon ‘Æsthetic Philosophy,’ and meeting with great, though not 
            unvaried, success. The paradoxical nature 
            of his utterances at times excited disgust. 
            A cablegram to England expressed his ‘disappointment’ with the Atlantic, and he 
            finally came to the conclusion that the English ‘have really everything in common with 
            the Americans—except, of course, language.’ 
            A drama by him, called ‘Vera,’ was produced in New York during his stay then in 
            1882.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="Seccombe1900DNB_p003">
            For five or six years after his return from 
            America Wilde resided chiefly in London in 
            comparative privacy, but paid frequent visits 
            to Paris and travelled on the continent. In 
            1884 he married Constance, daughter of 
            Horace Lloyd, Q.C., and in 1888 he com- 
            menced a period of literary activity, which 
            was progressive until the collapse of his 
            career in 1895. This period opened with 
            ‘The Happy Prince and other Tales’ (1888, 
            illustrated by Walter Crane and Jacomb 
            Hood), a volume of charming fairy tales 
            with a piquant touch of contemporary satire. 
            In 1891 appeared ‘Lord Arthur Savile’s 
            Crime, and other Stories’ and ‘The Picture 
            of Dorian Gray.’ The novel last mentioned,

            which was first published in ‘Lippincott's 
            Magazine,’ was full of subtle impressionism 
            and highly wrought epigram, but owed notoriety to an undercurrent of very disagreeable 
            suggestion. A ‘Preface to Dorian Gray,’ 
            concluding ‘All Art is quite useless,’ appeared separately in the ‘Fortnightly Review’ (March 1891).
            In the previous number of the ‘Review’ readers had been more 
            than ever bewildered by Wilde's exceptionally brilliant plea for socialism, on the ground 
            that it would relieve us of ‘the sordid necessity of living for others.’ Later in the same 
            year Wilde reprinted some ‘literary wild 
            oats’ under the title ‘Intentions’ (three contributions to leading reviews). One of these, 
            on ‘Masks,’ revealed an intimate knowledge 
            of Shakespeare. ‘A House of Pomegranates’ 
            (more fairy tales), 1892, was taken in the 
            main at the author's valuation as ‘intended 
            neither for the British child nor the British 
            public.’

            Meanwhile in 1891 a blank-verse tragedy 
            by Wilde, called ‘The Duchess of Padua.’ 
            was produced in New York, and subsequently he found a more profitable mode 
            of expression for his literary abilities in 
            light comedies, which, despite his very narrow 
            experience of modern stage conditions, were 
            remarkable equally for theatrical and for 
            literary skill. His first light comedy, ‘Lady 
            Windermere's Fan,’ was produced at the St. 
            James's Theatre on 20 Feb. 1892, and was 
            printed next year. It was full of saucy 
            repartee and overdone with epigram of the 
            pattern peculiar to the author, namely, the 
            inverted proverb, but it made a hit. It was 
            followed at the Haymarket Theatre in April 
            1893 by ‘A Woman of no Importance,’ a 
            drama of a similar kind, to the theatrical 
            success of which the fine acting of Mr. Tree 
            and Mrs. Bernard Beere greatly contributed 
            (printed 1894, 4to).

            In the summer of 1893 the licenser of 
            plays refused to sanction the performance of 
            ‘Salomé,’ a play of more serious character, 
            written in French. This was a marvel of 
            mimetic power, which owed most perhaps to 
            Flaubert's ‘Herodias;’ it was printed as 
            ‘Salomé, Drame en un acte’ (1893, 4to), and 
            was rendered into English by Wilde's friend, 
            Lord Alfred Douglas, in 1894 (London, 4to; 
            with ten pictures by Aubrey Beardsley). 
            The original version was produced by 
            Madame Sarah Bernhardt in Paris in 1894. 
            In 1894 was also published ‘The Sphinx’ 
            (dedicated to Marcel Schwob), a poetical catalogue of
            ‘amours frequent and free,’ presented in the metre of ‘In Memoriam.’ In 
            the same year, in a paper entitled ‘Phrases 
            and Philosophies for the use of the Young,’ 
            
        <cb n="2"/>
            
            Wilde gave the tone to a magazine called 
            ‘The Chameleon,’ two numbers of which were 
            issued at Oxford in a very limited edition. 
            The tortured paradoxes of the new cult were 
            effectively parodied in Mr. Hichens's ‘Green 
            Carnation.’ To the ‘Fortnightly’ of July 
            1894 Wilde contributed some curious ‘Poems 
            in Prose.’ He could write English of silken 
            delicacy, but in his choice of epithets there 
            are frequently traces of that ‘industry’ which 
            he denounced as the ‘root of all ugliness.’ 
            A third comedy, ‘The Ideal Husband,’ was 
            successfully produced at the Haymarket on 
            3 Jan. 1895, although it was not printed 
            until 1899. On 14 Feb. 1895 was given at 
            the St. James's Theatre a fourth play in the 
            light vein, ‘The Importance of being Earnest : a trivial comedy for serious people’ 
            (1899, 4to), an irresistible dramatic trifle, at 
            once insolent in its levity and exquisite in 
            its finish. The Victorian era, it may fairly 
            be said, knew no light comedies which for 
            brilliant wit, literary finish, or theatrical 
            dexterity were comparable with Wilde's 
            handiwork.

            The manuscript of a poetical drama by 
            Wilde, entitled ‘A Florentine Tragedy,’ was 
            stolen from his house in Tite Street in 1895, 
            together with an enlarged version of an essay 
            on Shakespeare's sonnets, entitled ‘The History of Mr. W. H.,’
            of which an outline appeared in ‘Blackwood's Magazine’ in July 
            1889 (‘The Portrait of Mr. W. H.’)

            In the month following the successful 
            production of ‘The Importance of being 
            Earnest’ Wilde brought, with fatal insolence, 
            an unsuccessful action for criminal libel 
            against the Marquis of Queensberry. In the 
            result he was himself arrested and charged 
            with offences under the Criminal Law Amendment Act,
            and being found guilty after a protracted trial at the Old Bailey on 27 May 1895, 
            he was sentenced by Mr. Justice Wills to 
            two years' imprisonment with hard labour. 
            Ruined in fortune as well as in fame, he soon 
            afterwards passed through the bankruptcy 
            court. While in prison he wrote a kind of 
            apology for his life, a manuscript amounting 
            to about forty-five thousand words, now in 
            the hands of his literary executor, and also 
            studied Dante assiduously, contemplating 
            an essay on ‘The Divine Comedy’ which 
            should develop a new theory. On 19 May 
            1897 he was released from prison. Thenceforth his necessities were provided for by a 
            small annuity purchased by his friends. 
            After spending some time at Berneval, he 
            in 1898 made his headquarters at the Hotel 
            d'Alsace, Paris. While at Berneval he wrote 
            and issued anonymously in London a powerful
            ‘Ballad of Reading Gaol’ (1898), the

            sincerity of which is overlaid by an excess
            of rhetoric. Thenceforth he wrote nothing. 
            He adopted the name Sebastian Melmoth—Melmoth
            from the romance of Maturin, a 
            connection of his mother, Lady Wilde, 
            Sebastian suggested by the arrows on the 
            prison dress. He had contributed some information
            to the 1892 edition of ‘Melmoth the 
            Wanderer.’

            After visiting Sicily and Rome in the 
            spring of 1900, Wilde died of cerebral 
            meningitis at the Hotel d'Alsace on 30 Nov. 
            1900. He received the last rites of the 
            Roman catholic church. Shortly before his
            death he expressed his conviction that his
            ‘moral obliquity’ was due to the fact that
            his father had prevented him from entering
            the Roman church when he was at Oxford,
            adding, ‘The artistic side of the church and
            the fragrance of its teaching would have
            curbed my degeneracies.’ He was buried in
            the Bagneux cemetery on 3 Dec., his tomb-
            stone bearing the inscription: ‘Ci-git Oscar
            Wilde, poete et auteur dramatique.’ His
            wife had died in 1896. Two sons—Cyril,
            born in 1885, and Vivian in 1886—survived
            Both parents.
